This repository contains various Java programming solutions for common exercises, focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, **encapsulation**, **abstraction**, and more. The examples cover a wide range of scenarios, from simple loops to more complex systems like a retail store management system.
