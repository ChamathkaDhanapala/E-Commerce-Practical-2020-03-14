# Java Programming Solutions

This repository contains various Java programming solutions for common exercises, focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, **encapsulation**, **abstraction**, and more. The examples cover a wide range of scenarios, from simple loops to more complex systems like a retail store management system.

## Hello World Program
This is a simple Java program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

## Print Numbers from 1 to 10
This program prints numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.

## Print Numbers in Reverse
This program prints numbers from 10 to 1 in reverse using a for loop.

## Print Odd Numbers Between 1 to 20
This program prints all odd numbers between 1 and 20 using an if statement inside a for loop.

## Reverse the Left and Right Numbers
This program reverses the left and right sides of a number using a single for loop. The user can input a number, and the program will reverse the left and right portions accordingl.

## Student Class: Average Marks
This program defines a Student class and calculates the average marks of five students.

## Library Management System
This program demonstrates the use of inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation by implementing a library management system. Different types of books are available (Printed books, E-books, and Audiobooks).

## Retail Store Management System
This project implements a Retail Store Management System with inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. It can handle different types of products (fruits, vegetables, and groceries) and provides functionality to add, edit, delete, and display products.
